The Python notebook documenting the process is named FinalProject.ipynb, the Python code is named FinalProject.py, the Python toolbox is named FinalProject1_json.pyt, and the layout pdf is named Geog4057Final.pdf. The rest of the files were created in the process of running the code and creating the layout. The purpose of this project was to use a script to modify data to make it usable within a ArcGIS environment and demonstrate an example of the results.

The code was developed by taking the publicly available 2018 Land Value for New Orleans JSON data from data.gov. Since the file contained data in the form of Well-Known Text, it had to be edited before it could be used in GIS contexts. The Python code provided converts this unusable data, writes fields for a feature class, creates a feature class, and creates a geoprocessing tool that allows other users to input their own JSON file data and convert it to a usuable shapefile. Within the ArcGIS interface, the tool is named Import No Tax JSON to Feature Class, and allows the user to input their workspace folder and no_tax.json file to be converted to a shapefile. 

The process of creating the code is documented in the .ipynb file. The final code and toolbox are FinalProject.py and FinalProject1_json.pyt respectively. The tool was run to create a map layout displaying clustered zones of the New Orleans area according to the data acquired from data.gov, viewable as the pdf Geog4057Final.pdf.
